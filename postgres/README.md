# Postgres Demo

## Introduction
In this section we introduce the Postgres database engine so to perform several tasks:
1. Create the 'university' database
2. Create tables 'students', 'grades_high_school', 'grades_university'
3. Add sample data to all tables
4. Export all data to CSV files

In a production system, the data probable are already stored in a Postgres server and we only need to perform task 4. Export data to CSV files.
However, as this is a demonstration we also need to create the data.

## Iteration 2 - Phase A - Export data from postgres
As it can be seen in the project documentation,  postgres  is being  utilised in Iteration 2 and the rest of this document guides through the several phases so to fulfill that particular task.

__Warning__: This is an advanced tutorial. HDP 2.6.5 comes with Postgres already installed, accompanied with several security configurations.
To avoid configuration changes that might break the system, we need to perform many steps.

__Info__: In case you find difficult to follow these steps, the CSV files have been included in this folder so you can continue your analysis.



At this point you can return to the documentation and continue your analysis by first uploading the data into HDFS.
